## Avengers

Labeled Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers ~~consists~~ originally consisted of **Hank Pym**, **the Hulk**, **Iron Man**, **Thor**, and **the Wasp**. The original Captain America was discovered, trapped in ice (issue #4), and joined the group after they revived him. A rotating roster became a hallmark, although one theme remained consistent: the Avengers fight "the foes *no single* superhero can withstand." The team, famous for its battle cry of "Avengers Assemble!", has featured humans, mutants, inhumans, robots, aliens, supernatural beings, and even former villains.

> "Everything I've done, everything I'll do today, everything I'll ever do, I do to protect this world. Someone once told me that with great power comes great responsibility. That's usually thought of as a lesson for children. A simple injunction to do the right thing. But there's nothing simple about it. When I put on this armor, I took on more power than any human was ever intended to have... and maybe more responsibility than my heart can truly bear. But today... I will do my job. I will protect you. No matter what it takes..."
